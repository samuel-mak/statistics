- **Pearson's Chi-squared test (Pearson, 1900)**
  - **Concept**
    - A statistical test that tests the null hypothesis that 2 categorical variables are independent 
    - Test of independence between 2 categorical variable is like a test of homogeneity of conditional distributions 
      - For example, if factor A and factor B are independent, then the conditional probabilities are homogeneous ($P(\text{Married once} | \text{College}) = P( \text{Married once}| \text{No College})$)
    - **Conceptual Hypotheses**
      - **Null Hypothesis**
        - The two categorical variables are independent 
      - **Alternative Hypothesis**
        - The two categorical variables are not independent (they are associated)
  - **The probability of each cell under the null hypothesis**
    - **Concept**
      - The probability of each joint-category under the null hypothesis 
    - **Mathematics**
      - $\pi_{ij} = \pi_{i\cdot} \pi_{\cdot j}$
    - **Estimation**
      - **Concept**
        - The maximum likelihood estimation of the population probability of each of the joint-categories 
      - **Mathematics**
        - $\displaystyle \hat{\pi}_{ij} = \hat\pi_{i\cdot} \hat\pi_{\cdot j} = \frac{n_{i \cdot}}{n} \times \frac{n_{\cdot j}}{n} = \frac{n_{i \cdot} n_{\cdot j}}{n^2}$
          - ***Where***
            - $n_{i\cdot}$ - The number of observations in the $i$^th^ row
            - $n_{\cdot j}$ - The number of observations in the $j$^th^ column 
            - $n$ - The total sample size
  - **The expected number of observations**
    - **Concept**
      - The number of observations in each of the K joint-categories under the null hypothesis that the 2 categorical variables are independent 
    - **Mathematics**
      - $\displaystyle E(n_{ij}) = n\hat{\pi}_{ij} = n\frac{n_{i \cdot} n_{\cdot j}}{n^2} = \frac{n_{i \cdot} n_{\cdot j}}{n}$
  - **Pearson's Chi-squared statistic**
    - **Concept**
      - The sum of the standardised squared deviations of the observed number of observations and the expected number of observations under the null hypothesis of each of the K joint-categories 
    - **Mathematics**
      - $\begin{aligned} \displaystyle \chi^2 &= \sum_{i = 1}^{I}{\sum_{j = 1}^{J}{\frac{\left[ n_{ij} - E(n_{ij})\right]^2}{E(n_{ij})}}} \\ \displaystyle &= \sum_{i = 1}^{I}{\sum_{j = 1}^{J}{\frac{\left( n_{ij} - \frac{n_{i\cdot} n_{\cdot j}}{n}\right)^2}{\frac{n_{i\cdot} n_{\cdot j}}{n}}}} \end{aligned}$
        - ***Where***
          - $n_{ij}$ - The observed number of observations in joint-category $ij$
          - $E(n_{jk}$ - The expected number of observations in joint-category $ij$ under the null hypothesis
          - $\left( n_{ij} - \frac{n_{i\cdot} n_{\cdot j}}{n}\right)^2$ - The squared deviation for for joint-category $ij$
    - **Degrees of freedom (NOT ENTIRELY SURE)**
      - **Concept**
        - The degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis is the number of joint-categories minus the number of independent linear restrictions placed on the cell probabilities 
        - Although the calculation of the number of degrees of freedom depends on the application of the Chi-squared test, the general principle is that the appropriate number of degrees of freedom will equal the number of joint-categories minus 1 df for each independent linear restriction placed on the cell probabilities. In some applications, other restrictions may also be introduced because of the necessity for estimating unkown parameters required in the calculation of the expected cell frequencies or because of the method used to collect the sample 
        - There is always one linear restriction in each cell because the sum of the cell probabilities must equal 1 ($p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + \cdots + p_k = 1$)
      - **Mathematics**
        - $df = IJ - 1 - (I-1) - (J-1) = (I-1)(J-1)$
          - ***Note***
            - The equation shows that df is the total number of joint-categories ($IJ$) minus the number of restrictions in the $I$ rows, minus the number of restrictions in the $J$ columns, and minus the number of restrictions in all the cells as a whole (minus the 1) (NOT ENTIRELY SURE)
      - **Introduction**
        - The calculation of the number of degrees of freedom depends on the application of the Chi-squared test 
        - The general principle is that the appropriate number of degrees of freedom will equal the number of cells, k, less 1 df for each independent linear restriction placed on the cell probabilities 
        - There is always one linear restriction in each cell because the sum of the cell probabilities must equal 1 ($p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + \cdots + p_k = 1$)
    - **Distribution of the Chi-squared statistic**
      - **Concept**
        - $X^2$ tends towards a chi-squared distribution as n increases (it can be shown)
        - The square root of the chi-squared statistic is a normal random variable (normally distributed)
        - The square of a normal random variable has a chi-squared distribution 
        - Hence, the chi-squared statistic has a chi-square distribution 
      - **Mathematics**
        - $X^2 \sim \chi$
    - **NHST**
      - **Concept**
        - Tests the probability of having a Chi-squared statistic equal to or larger than the observed Chi-squared statistic in the Chi-square distribution under the null hypothesis 
      - **Hypotheses**
        - $H_0: \pi_{ij} = \pi_{i \cdot}\pi_{\cdot j}, ~~~~~ \text{for} ~ i = 1:I, j = 1:J$
  - **Some caveats**
    - **Number of cell counts**
      - There is a rule of thumb that it is all expected cell counts are required to be at least 5. 
      - Although Cochran (1952) noted that his can be as low as one for some situations

        
 
- **Odds Ratio**
  - **Odds**
    - **Concept**
      - The ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring 
    - **Mathematics**

    - **Conditional Odds**
      - **Concept**
        - The ratio of the probability of an event occurring given a value/level of another categorical variable to the probability of it not occurring 
      - **Mathematics**
        - $\displaystyle Odds(A | x) = \frac{P(A | x)}{1 - (A | x)}$
  - **The Odds Ratio**  
    - **Concept**
      - The ratio of the odds of an event given a value of a categorical variable and the odds of the same event given another value of the same categorical variable 
      - This ratio tells the influence of the level of the second categorical variable in the numerator have on the probability of the event of interest
    - **Mathematics**
      - $\displaystyle OR(A) = \frac{Odds(A|x_1)}{Odds{(A|x_2)}}$
        
        
        
- **Bernoulli Trails**
  - **Concept**
    - A Bernoulli trial is a random independent experiment with 2 possible outcomes (usually referred to as "success" or "failure") and the probability of the "success" event ($\pi$) is the same every time the experiment is conducted (identical trials) and the outcome of each of the trials does not influence the outcome of other trials (independent trials; sampling with replacement) 
    - $y_i$ - The outcome of Bernoulli trial $i$ in the sequence of $n$ trials - 1 indicates that the "success" event had occurred and 0 indicates that the "failure" event had occurred in trial $i$
    - $y$ - The total number of "success" events in a sequence of $n$ trials - $y = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{y_i}$
    - $y$ is treated as an independent random variable that can vary between the 2 possible outcomes (the "success" event or the "failure" event)
    - Bernoulli process - When there is a sequence of Bernoulli trials 
    - $p= 1-q$
    - $p$ - The probability of event occurring 
    - $q$ - The probability of the event not occurring
    
<p style = "margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 20px; ">**Binomial Distribution**</p>

- **Binomial Distribution**
  - **Concept**
    - A special case of the multinomial distribution when the number of trials $K = 2$
    - A discrete probability distribution for the discrete independent random variable ($y$) of the number of the "success" events in a sequence of a fixed/finite $n$ number of Bernoulli trials/experiments (independent, identical) (the x-axis represents the number of successes; the y-axis represents the probability)
    - (if trials are not independent or identical, $y$ will not follow a binomial distribution, they will follow other distributions; e.g. hypergeometric distribution is for the case when trials are not independent; specifically, it samples without replacement)
    - A Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution where $n = 1$
    - The binomial distribution has 2 parameters, $n$, the number of Bernoulli experiments in the sequence, and $\pi$, the probability of each of the numbers of "success" events 
    - An independent random variable ($y$) that has an approximate binomial distribution is denoted as $y \sim B(n, \pi)$
  - **Binomial probability mass function**
    - **Concept**
      - The probability mass function for the binomial distribution
    - **Mathematics**
      - $P(y) = {n\choose y} \pi^y (1 - \pi)^{n - y} ~~~, y = 0:n$
        - ***Notes***

        - $\sigma^2 = n\pi(1-\pi)$
    - **Characteristics of the binomial distribution**
      - **$\pi$ and Skewness (biasedness)**
        - **Concept**
          - The binomial is symmetric when $\pi = 0.50$ regardless of $n$ 
          - The binomial distribution becomes more positively skewed as $\pi$ decreases from $0.50$ towards 0
          - The binomial distribution becomes more negatively skewed as $\pi$ increases from $0.50$ towards 1
        - **Mathematics**
          - The skewness is described by the following equality:
          - $\displaystyle \frac{\text{E}(y-\mu)^3}{\sigma^3} = \frac{1-2\pi}{\sqrt{n\pi(1 - \pi)}}$
      - **$n$ and normality**
        - **Concept**
          - The binomial distribution converges to normality as $n$ increases
          - For fixed $\pi$, the binomial distribution can be reasonably assumed to be normal when $n[\min(\pi, 1–\pi)]$ is as small as about 5 (Agresti, 2013, p.5)

- **Statistical Inference with the Binomial distribution (Not developed)**
  - **Wald test**
    - **Concept**
      - A test statistic in which the standard error nonnull estimated (not the standard error of population distribution under the null hypothesis)
    - **The Wald statistic for probability**    
      - **Mathematics**
        - $\displaystyle W = \frac{(p - \pi)^2}{Var(p_i)} $
    - **The Wald z statistic**
      - $\displaystyle z_W = \frac{p - \pi}{SE} = \frac{p - \pi}{\frac{\sqrt{\hat\pi(1 - \hat\pi)}}{n}}$



- **Multinomial distribution**
  - **Concept**
    - A discrete probability distribution for the discrete independent random variable ($y$) of the combination of numbers with each number being the number of occurrence of each of the multiple possible outcomes in a sequence of a fixed/finite $n$ number of random independent and identical trial/experiment 
    - The categorical distribution is a special case of the multinomial distribution where $n = 1$
    - The probability of obtaining a combination of $n_1, n_2, \cdots, n_k$ is denoted as $\text{P}(n_1, n_2, \cdots, n_k)$ where $n_k$ is the number of occurrence for outcome $k$ in a sequence of $n$ random, independent, and identical trials 
    - <details> <summary> Alternative text </summary> In 1 trial, there are multiple (but fixed) number of possible outcomes, the outcome of a trial is represented by a combination (e.g. if there are 4 possible outcomes, the combination could be 0, 1, 0, 0, meaning that the outcome for this trial is category 2). Now imagine we have $16$ of this trial, the combination could be something like 4, 4, 4, 4. The multinomial distribution models the probability of getting different combinations. In the case of 4, 4, 4, 4, this is a fair trial (the null hypothesis), where each of the categories have equal chance of occurrence, so this combination after $16$ trials would be the most probable (it has a probability of 0.50), whereas a combination of something like 6, 5, 3, 2 would be less probable in the null multinomial distribution </details>
    - **The outcome of a single multinomial trial ($y_i$)**
      - **Concept**
        - The outcome of a single random, independent and identical multinomial trial 
        - The outcome can be one of multiple but fixed number of possible outcomes 
      - **Mathematics**
        - $y_i = (y_{i,1}, y_{i,2}, \cdots , y_{i,k})$
          - ***Where***
            - $k$ - The number of possible outcomes of a single trial 
    - **The outcome of a sequence of $n$ multinomial trials**
      - **Concept**
        - The number of occurrence of each of the $k$ outcomes after a sequence of $n$ random, independent, and identical trials 
        - This is represented as a combination of $k$ numbers with each number representing the number of occurrence of each of the $k$ outcomes after a sequence of $n$ random, independent, and identical trials
      - **Mathematics**
        - $y = (n_1, n_2, \cdots , n_k)$
  - **Multinomial probability mass function**
    - **Concept**
      - A function that models the probability of each of all possible outcome combinations 
      - The multinomial distribution has $K - 1$ dimensions because $y_{i,k}$ is linearly dependent on the others and therefore is redundant
    - **Mathematics**
      - $\displaystyle \text{P}(n_1, n_2, \cdots , n_{k-1}) = \left( \frac{n!}{\Pi_{k = 1}^{K}{n_k!}} \right) \Pi_{k = 1}^{K}{\pi_{k}^{n_k}}$

      - **Mathematics**
        - $\text{Cov}(n_j, n_k) = -n\pi_j\pi_k$
  
- **Poisson distribution**
  - **History**
    - Introduced by Poisson (1781 - 1840) and published with his probability theory in his work Recherches sur la probabilité des judgements en matié criminelle et en matiére civile (1837) where he theorised about the number of wrongful convictions in a given country by fousing on certain random variables N that count the number of discrete occurrenses that take place during a time-interval of given length 
    - Newcomb (1860) applied the Poisson distribution to estimate the distribution of the number of stars found in a unit of space
    - Bortkiewicz (1898) applied the Poisson distribution to estimate the number of soldiers in the Prussian army killed accidentally by horse kicks (this experiment introduced the Poisson distribution to the field of reliability engineering)
  - **Concept**
    - A discrete probability distribution of the discrete independent random variable ($y$) of the number of the "success" events in a sequence of an infinite number of Bernoulli trials/experiments (independent, identical) within a fixed time interval and space 
    - The Poisson distribution is used for the number of events that occur randomly over a fixed window of time or space when outcomes in disjoint periods or regions are independent 
    - The Poisson distribution can be used for the binomial case when $n$ is larger and $\pi$ is small (then $\mu = n\pi$)
    - The Poisson distribution is conceptually similar to the binomial distribution, the difference is that the binomial distribution has a fixed number of trials ($n$), meanwhile, the Poisson distribution has an infinite number of trials (an infinite population of trials)
  - **Poisson probability mass function**
    - **Mathematics**
      - $\displaystyle \text{P}(y) = \frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^{y}}{y!}~~~ y = 0:.$ 
        - ***Where***
          - $y$ - The number of times an event occurred (sometimes it is denoted as $k$)
          - $\mu$ - The expected number of times an event occurred (sometimes it is denoted as $\lambda$)
        - ***Notes**
          - Sometimes it is expressed as such 
    - **Mean of the Poisson PMF**
      - **Concept**
        - The number of occurrence of an event in the null Poisson distribution
      - **Mathematics**
        - $\mu = \text{E}(y_i) = \lambda$
    - **Mode of the Poisson distribution**
      - **Concept**
        - The mode equals to the integer part of $\mu$
    - **Variance of the Poisson PMF**
      - **Concept**
        - The variance of the Poisson PMF is the same as its mean 
      - **Mathematics**
        - $\text{Var}(y_i) = \text{E}(y_i)$
    - **Skewness**
      - The Poisson distribution approaches normal as $\mu$ increases (when $\mu$ is at least 10 it can be assumed to be normal)
      - **Mathematics**
        - The skewness is described by the following equality
        - $\displaystyle \frac{\text{E}(y - \mu)^3}{\sigma^3} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu}}$


- **Binomial and Poission distribution and the problem of Overdispersion**
  - **Concept**
    - Modelling count observations with binomial or Poission distributions often result in overdispersion. 
    - $\mu$ can vary because of unmeasured factor
    - Unconditionally, 
      - The Expectation is 
        - $E(y) = E[E(y | \mu)]$
      - The variance is 
        - $\text{Var}(y) = E[\text{Var}(y|\mu)] + \text{Var}[E(y|\mu)]$
        

        
- **Overdispersion**
  - **Concept**
    - The phenomenon in which the observed variability in the real world is larger than the variability predicted by the statistical model
    - This may cause inaccurate inferences 
    - Overdispersion is a common feature because in practice populations are frequently heterogeneous 
    - Count observations using the binomial or Poission distribution often encounter this problem 


    
    
    
<p style = "margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 20px; ">**Likelihood**</p>

- **Likelihood**
  - **Concept**
    - The probability of the observed sample data/datum as a function of the parameters of the chosen statistical model/distribution
    - In the case of data (when there are multiple observations), it is the joint probability between the observations under the statistical model/distribution given the values of the parameters of the statistical model/distribution
  - **Related terms**
    - **Kernel** - The part of a likelihood function that involves the model parameters (the relevant part of the likelihood function)
  - **Mathematics**
    - $\displaystyle \mathcal{L}(\theta | X) = \text{PF}(x_i)$
      - ***Where***
        - $\theta$ - The parameter of the chosen statistical model 
        - $X$ - The observed sample data 
      - ***Notes***
        - It can also be written as $\text{P}(X | \theta)$, but this is less commonly used
        
        
- **The likelihood function of a random sample**
  - **Concept**
    - A function that describes the likelihood of a random sample data/datum as a function of the values of the parameters of the chosen statistical model
    - The graph of the likelihood function is the likelihood against the values of the parameter(s) of the chosen statistical model
    - The graph is concave for most models 
  - **Mathematics**
    - $\displaystyle \mathcal{L}(\theta; \mathbf{x}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n}{f(x_i; \theta)} $
      - ***Where***
        - $f(x_i; \theta)$ - The probability density function (PDF) for the variable of interest (in this example here the statistical model has only one parameter, $\theta$, when it has two parameters, let's say $\sigma^2$, then it is expressed as $f(x_i; \theta, \sigma^2)$)
        - $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots , x_n)'$ - The observed random variable/data 
      - ***Notes***
        - $\mathcal{L}(\theta; \mathbf{x})$ can be denoted as $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$
  - **Log likelihood function**
    - **Concept**
      - The log of the likelihood/likelihood function
      - The log likelihood function is often used instead of the likelihood function because it is more convenient to use and it simplifies many of the later calculations (e.g. it is a sum rather than product of terms)
      - No information is lost from logging the likelihood because the log is a one-to-one function
      - Since the log is a strictly increasing function, the values of the model parameters that maximise $\mathcal{l}(\theta; \text{x})$ are the same as the values that maximise $\mathcal{L}(\theta; \mathbf{x})$
    - **Mathematics**
      - $\displaystyle \mathcal{l}(\theta; \text{x})=\log{\mathcal{L}(\theta; \text{x})} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\log f(x_i; \theta)}$
      - ***Notes***
        - $\mathcal{l}(\theta; \text{x})$ can be denoted as $\mathcal{l}(\theta)$

    
    
    
        
        
<p style = "margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 20px; ">**Maximum Likelihood Estimation**</p>

- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**
  - **Concept**
    - An estimation method in which the model parameters are estimated by finding the parameters of the statistical model that maximizes the likelihood of the data through setting the partial derivative of the likelihood function of the data to 0 
    - Because the likelihood curve is concave, setting this to 0 will get the maxima of the curve; the point that represents the maximum likelihood of the data)
  - **Mathematics**
    - The value of $\theta$ with the maximum likelihood of the data 
      - $\hat\theta = Argmax\mathcal{L}(\theta; \mathbf{x})$
        - ***Where***
          - $Argmax\mathcal{L}(\theta; \mathbf{x})$ - This notation means that $\mathcal{L}(\theta; \mathbf{x})$ achieves its maximum value at $\hat\theta$ - The value of $\theta$ with the maximum likelihood 
    - The value of $\theta$ with the maximum likelihood of the data is found through maximisation of the likelihood function by setting the partial derivative of the likelihood function to 0 
    - $\displaystyle \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = 0$
      - ***Notes***
        - The log likelihood function can be used but I just used the likelihood function here
        - This is an estimating equation (EE), an equation for estimating the population parameters
        - If there are multiple parameters (e.g. a normal distribution that has parameter $\mu$ and $\sigma$), the parameters are solved through setting each of the partial derivative for each of the parameters to 0
- **Properties of the MLEs (THIS SECTION IS NOT DEVELOPED)**
  - **Theorem 1**
    - **Concept**
      - If the parameter of interest $\eta $ is the parameter $\theta$ in some sort of function $g(\theta)$, ($\eta =g(\theta)$), then the mle of $\theta$ in the same function is the mle of $eta$ ($\hat\eta$)
      - $g(\hat\theta)$ is the MLE of $\eta = g(\theta)$
      - $\hat\eta = g(\hat\theta)$
      - "In some situations, besides the parameter $\theta$, we are also interested in the parameter $\eta = g(\theta)$, it can be shown that the mle of $\eta$ is $\hat\eta = g(\hat\theta)$ where $\hat\theta$ is the mle of $\theta$"
  - **Theorem 2**
    - **Concept**
      - The larger the sample size, the closer the mle is to the true parameter value ??? DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS 
      
- **Hessian matrix**
  - **Concept**
    - A square matrix in which each of the elements of the matrix is a second-order partial derivative of the function of interest with respect to the square of each of the variables 
    - A square matrix that describes the change in the rate of change at a particular point of a function (local curvature) of multiple variables

- **Information**
  - **Concept**
    - A quantity that quantifies the amount of information that an observable random variable carries about an unknown parameter of a statistical model/distribution of that random variable 
    - Through derivations, it can be shown that Fisher Information can be defined in terms of the variance of the score or the curvature of the likelihood function
  - **Information defined as the variance of the score (a random variable)**
    - **Concept**
      - Information can be defined as the variance of the random variable of the score ($\frac{\partial \mathcal{l}(\theta; \text{x})}{\partial \theta}$)
    - **Mathematics** 
      - $\displaystyle I(\theta) = E\left[\left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{l}(\theta; \text{x})}{\partial \theta}\right)^2 | \theta \right] = \text{Var}\left( \frac{\partial\mathcal{l}(\theta; \text{x})}{\partial \theta} | \theta\right)$
  - **Information defined as the Curvature of the likelihood function**
    - **Concept**
      - Information can be defined or expressed in terms of the curvature of the graph of the (log) likelihood function of the observed data/datum under certain regularity conditions (e.g. the log likelihood function is twice differentiable with respect to $\theta$)
      - The greater the curvature of the graph of the likelihood function, the more information the data has about the unknown parameters of the model (in the extreme case when the graph of the likelihood function is at the highest at a single value of the parameter and 0 at all other values of the parameter, in other words, the likelihood is non-zero at a single point in the parameter space, the data contains complete information about the value of the parameter)
      - The smaller the curvature of the graph of the likelihood function, the less information the data has about the unknown parameters of the model (if the graph of the likelihood function is flat, that is, when the likelihood is the same across values of the parameter, then the data contains no information at all about the value of the parameter)
    - Mathematically, information defined as the curvature of the likelihood graph is the negative of the expectation of the Hessian matrix where each element is the second derivative of the (log) likelihood function
    - **Mathematics**
      - $\displaystyle \textbf{I}(\theta) = -E(\textbf{H}| \theta) \\ \displaystyle \textbf{I}(\theta) = -E\left[\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{l}(\theta; \text{x})}{\partial \theta^2} | \theta\right]$

    - Under regularity conditions, the variance-covariance of model parameters is the inverse of the information weighted by n (sample size) (Rao, 1973, p.364; Rao Cramer lower bound)
  - **Mathematics**
    - **For one parameter**
      - $\begin{aligned} \displaystyle \text{Var}(\hat\theta) &= \sigma_{\hat\theta}^{2}= \frac{1}{n}I^{-1}(\hat\theta) = \frac{1}{nI(\hat\theta)} \\ \displaystyle \text{SE}(\hat\theta) &= \sqrt{\sigma_{\hat\theta}^{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}I^{-1}(\hat\theta)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{nI(\hat\theta)}} \end{aligned}$
    - **For multiple parameters**
      - $\displaystyle \textbf{Cov}(\hat\theta) = \frac{1}{n}\textbf{I}^{-1}(\theta)$
        - ***Notes***

- **Unbiasedness of an estimator**
  - **Definition**
    - Let $x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots , x_n$ be a sample on a random variable $X$ with pdf $f(x; \theta)$. Let $S = S(x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots , x_n)$ be a statistic. $S$ is an unbiased estimator of the population parameter $\theta$ if $E(S) = \theta$






- **Cramér-Rao Lower Bound**
  - **Concept**
    - The CRLB states that the variance of an estimator cannot be lower than the CRLB
    - That is, the CRLB is the smallest possible variance of an estimator 
  - **For unbiased or biased estimators**
    - **Mathematics**
      - This is for the case when $\hat\theta$ can be an unbiased or biased estimator of $\theta$, that is when the expectation of $\hat\theta$ is not $\theta$ but some kind of function of this (e.g. $k(\theta)$)
      - Let $x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots, x_n$ be idd with a pdf $f(x; \theta)$. Let $S = u(x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots, x_n)$ be a sample statistic with a mean $E(S) = E[u(x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots, x_n)] = k(\theta)$. Under the first 4 regularity conditions: 
        - $\displaystyle \text{Var}(\theta) ≥ \frac{\left[k'(\theta)\right]^2}{n I(\theta)}$
  - **For unbiased estimators**  
    - **Mathematics**
      - If $S = u(x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots, x_n)$ is an unbiased estimator of $\theta$, so that $k(\theta) = \theta$, then the Cramér-Rao inequality becomes: 
      - $\displaystyle \text{Var}(\hat\theta) ≥ \frac{1}{I(\theta)}$

- **Efficient Estimator**
  - **Concept** 
    - A sample statistic is an efficient estimator of the population parameter $\theta$ only if the variance of the sample statistic is equal to the Cramér-Rao lower bound 
  - **Efficiency**
    - **Concept**
      - The efficiency of an estimator is quantified as the ratio of the Cramér-Rao lower bound to the actual variance of an unbiased estimator 
    - **Mathematics**
      - $\displaystyle \text{Efficiency} = \frac{\textit{CRLB}}{\text{Var}(\theta)} \\ \displaystyle e(\hat\theta_{1n}) = \frac{\frac{1}{I(\theta_0)}}{\sigma^2_{\hat\theta_{1n}}}$
    - **Interpretation**
      - According to the CRLB, the variance cannot be lower than the CRLB
      - Hence, efficiency ranges from asymptotic 0 to 1
      - An efficiency of 1 means that the estimator is asymptotically efficient 
      - An efficiency smaller than 1 means that the estimator is inefficient 
      - The smaller the efficiency below 1 and towards 0, the less efficient is the estimator
  - **MLE and efficiency**
    - It can be shown that under regularity conditions, mles achieve an efficiency of 1 asymptotically. In other words, the variances of mles achieve their Cramér-Rao lower bounds asymptotically 

- **Regularity conditions of MLEs (DON'T FUCKING KNOW! Not developed)**
  1. The variables are independent and identically distributed with density $f(y; \theta)$
  2. The parameter space $\Theta$ is compact
  3. The value of the parameter is identified 
  4. The likelihood function is continuous in $\theta$
  5. $E_{\theta_0} \log f(Y; \theta)$ exists
  6. The log-likelihood function is such that $\frac{1}{n}\mathcal{L}(y; \theta)$ converges in probability to $E_{\theta_0} \log f(Y; \theta)$ uniformly in $\theta \in \Theta$
  7. The pdf is at least twice differentiable as a function of $\theta$
  8. Integration and differential operators are interchangeable - The order of integration and differentiation can be interchanged 
  9. The information matrix exists and is non-singular 
  10. The integral $\int f(x; \theta) dx$ can be differentiated twice under the integral sign as a function of $\theta$
- **Additional regularity conditions**

    - This means that the variance of an mle approaches the minimum variance (i.e. CRLB) as sample size increases towards infinity
    - The efficiency of mles converges to 1 as $n \rightarrow \infty$
    
    
- **MLEs are asymptotically normal**

    - Under certain regularity conditions and correct model specification, MLEs are asymptotically normal

- **MLEs are asymptotically consistent**
  - **Concept**
