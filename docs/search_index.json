\\bar{x})^2}}\\)) is a biased estimate of the true variance of the sampling distribution If errors are positively correlated, the standard mathematical expression of the estimate of the variance of the sampling distribution (\\(\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_{i,1} - \\bar{x})^2}}\\)) will underestimate the true value (a negative bias), this means that the true sampling variance and SE are larger than estimated, this means that OLS is less efficient/optimal than other estimators, this follows that all statistical inferences involving the SE will be biased (e.g. underestimating the confidence intervals, overestimating the p-value in significance tests, higher Type I error etc.) Assessing Autocorrelation See the autocorrelation section Treatment Autocorrelation consistent standard errors Cluster robust standard errors Use other estimators Normality of the Sampling Distribution Concept The sampling distribution of the sample estimates is normally distributed A normally distributed sampling distribution is desirable because it can be modelled easily with the normal distribution curve and inferential statistics can be easily derived (which may be easier than if it has a non-normal distribution, e.g. Pearson’s r) Effects of violation of the assumption All the standard mathematical expressions and procedures for estimating the inferential statistics and uncertainty of the sample estimate are based on the assumption that the sampling distribution is normal or at least approximately normal. If the true sampling distribution is not normal, then all the inferential statistics and estimates of uncertainty of the sample estimate are incorrect Assessing Normality of the sampling distribution Distribution of model residuals Description Assess whether the model residuals are normally distributed Explanation In general, in a linear combination of variables, if the variables in the linear combination are random, independent, and normally distributed (their sampling distribution), then the linear combination itself is also normally distributed (the sampling distribution of the linear combination is normal) Each of the regression parameters can be expressed as a linear combination \\(\\hat\\beta_{1} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x} )y_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}y_i}\\) Where \\(\\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}\\) is treated as a constant and \\(y_i\\) is treated a variable Hence, for the linear combination (\\(\\hat\\beta_1\\)) to be normally distributed, the random variable \\(y_i\\) has to be independent and normally distributed Since independence and normality of the errors imply independence and normality of the random variable \\(y_i\\), normality of errors can be used to indicate that the linear combination (\\(\\hat\\beta_1\\)) is normally distributed And since we don’t have the errors in hand, we use the model residuals Assessing normality See the ‘Assessing Normality’ section The Central Limit Theorem and the assumption of normality The distribution of the residuals is not important if sample size is “sufficiently” large according to the Central Limit Theorem. (The CLT states that the sampling distribution is approximately normal if sample size is large and can be assumed to be normal if sample size is sufficiently large (n &gt; 30) regardless of the shape of the population distribution) Hence, there is much less to worry about the non-normality of the sampling distribution if the sample size is “sufficiently” large Just some side notes \\(y_i\\) also needs to be normally distributed, if y is not normally distributed, then the scores of y need to be transformed such that it’s sampling distribution is normal or approximately normal (I am still not sure about this part) Treatment Use robust/non-parametric methods Transformation Heteroscedasticity Description Aka - Homogeneity of variance or constant variance The variance of the distribution of errors given x is the identical between values of x in the population model The variance of the distribution of errors given x is a constant - It is a fixed value and does not vary across values of x in the population model Some sources say that the variance of errors given x does not depend on x (e.g. Rice, 2006; Field, 2023) Visualisation Mathematics \\(\\text{Var}(\\epsilon_{i}) = \\sigma^2\\) Mathematics (Matrix) \\(\\boldsymbol\\Phi = E(\\epsilon\\epsilon&#39;|X) = \\Sigma_{\\epsilon\\epsilon} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma^{2} &amp; \\phi_{1,2} &amp; \\phi_{1,3} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi_{1,j} \\\\ \\phi_{2,1} &amp; \\sigma^{2} &amp; \\phi_{2,3} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi_{2,j} \\\\ \\phi_{3,1} &amp; \\phi_{3,2} &amp; \\sigma^{2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi_{3,j} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\phi_{i,1} &amp; \\phi_{i,2} &amp; \\phi_{i,3} &amp;\\cdots &amp; \\sigma^{2} \\end{bmatrix}\\) Notes The variances in the diagonals are all \\(\\sigma^2\\) The covariances in the off-diagonals can vary (the covariances are not the condition here) Effects of Homoscedasticity Biased estimation of sampling variance The mathematical expression for the estimate of the sampling variance assumes homoscedasticity (see derivation) (or rather, requires homoscedasticity to be unbiased). If there is heteroscedasticity, then the sampling variance estimated using the same standard mathematical expression will be biased, in that the estimated value is not the same as the true value, this in turn means that the parameter estimates are not optimal due to increased sampling variation and there are other estimators that will be mor efficient than OLS, the biased sampling variance estimate will affect the SE estimate, and will affect all statistical inferences using the sampling variance (e.g. confidence intervals, test statistic, p-values etc.) Confidence intervals can be “extremely inaccurate” when ignoring heteroscedasticity (Wilcox, 2010) But this assumption matters only if group sizes are unequal Assessing Homo/Heteroscedasticity Description The assumption applies to the population model, it is best to assess heteroscedasticity in the population through heteroscedasticity in the sample model Ways to assess heteroscedasticity Plots Statistical tests Plots Residual Plots Residuals vs fitted plot Residuals vs fitted plot Description The residuals are plotted against the fitted values A plot that shows the vertical distribution of residuals in the y-axis for each of the fitted values in the x-axis Basically it is the scatter plot but detrended It can be based on raw or standardised scores Visualisation ## Base R model &nbsp plot(model, which = 1) Statistical Tests Statistical Tests Levene’s test Brown-Forsythe test Hartley’s Fmax Levene’s tests Description Tests the null hypothesis that the variances in different groups are equal It is a one-way ANOVA with absolute deviation as the outcome variable and the groups/values of x as the predictor variable It tests whether the absolute deviation varies between groups/values of x Original Levene’s test Mathematics \\(\\textit{W} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{n_{g}(|\\bar{d}|_{g} - |\\bar{d}|_{G})^2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{n_{g}(|{d}|_{i} - |\\bar{d}|_{g})^2}} \\times \\frac{n-k}{k-1}\\) Where \\(g\\) - Denotes group \\(G\\) - Denotes grand \\(d_i = y_i - \\bar{y}_{g}\\) - A deviation means the difference between a score and mean of the group in which it belongs Note Levene’s test statistic is expressed as such but it can be interpreted as the F-statistic Brown-Forsythe test Description Similar to Levene’s test but uses the median in the absolute deviation instead (\\(d_i = y_i - \\tilde{y}_{g}\\)) Levene’s test using trimmed mean Description Similar to Levene’s test but uses the trimmed mean instead of the mean Comparing the tests Trimmed mean performed best when the underlying data followed a Cauchy distribution and the median performed best when the data followed a chi-squared distribution with 4 degrees of freedom (sharply skewed distribution) (Brown &amp; Forsythe, 1974; extracted from Wiki) Hartley’s Fmax (Pearson &amp; Harley, 1954) Description It is the ratio of the variances between the group with the biggest variance and the group with the smallest variance It then conducts a null hypothesis significance test for the ratio The Fmax isn’t used very often, so it is harder to find a critical value table Mathematics \\(\\textit{F}_{max} = \\frac{\\max{s_{g}^{2}}}{\\min{s_{g}^{2}}}\\) Where \\(\\max{s_{g}^{2}}\\) - The largest group variance among all the groups \\(\\min{s_{g}^{2}}\\) - The smallest group variance among all the groups Cochrane’s C test Description It tests whether the variance of a particular group is exceptionally larger than the rest of the group (it is an upper tail test) The test statistic is the ratio of the variane of a group of interest and the overall variance (of all of the groups) It then conducts a null hypothesis significance test on the ratio It is used to test for variance outlier Mathematics \\(\\textit{C}_{g} = \\frac{s_{g}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{s_{g}^{2}}}\\) Where \\(s_{g}^{2}\\) - The variance of a particular group \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{s_{g}^{2}}\\) - The sum of all the variances (the total variance) Null Hypothesis Significance Test Hypothesis \\(\\textit{H}_{0}:\\) All variances are equal \\(\\textit{H}_{1}:\\) At least one group variance is significantly larger than the other variances Don’t use these tests Sample size In large samples, even trivial heteroscedasticity can produce significant Levene’s result In small samples, Levene’s test has inadequate power to detect heteroscedasticity Group size equality Homoscedasticity tests work best when group sample sizes are equal (when heteroscedasticity does not matter as mentioned before) and does not work well when sample sizes are unequal (when heteroscedasticity matters) Adjust for it instead… There are robust methods for heteroscedasticity, hence, no need to drill on testing heteroscedasticity Read Zimmerman (2004) about the problems with heteroscedasticity tests… Remedies Heteroscedasticity-Consistent Standard Errors Weighted Least Squares Heteroscedasticity-Consistent Standard Error Description Aka Heteroscedasticity-Robust Standard Errors Robust Standard Errors Eicker-Huber-White standard errors Huber-White Standard Errors White Standard Errors Sandwich Estimator (because the matrix expression looks like a sandwich) Versions HC1 HC2 HC3 HC4 HC0 Description The first version of the HC standard error Mathematical desciption In the mathematical expression of the estimate of the sampling variance of the beta parameters, the variance of errors given x is not treated as fixed/a constant, rather, it relaxes the assumption of homoscedasticity and treat the variance of errors given x are different at different values of x Mathematics Population Model \\(\\textit{Var}(\\hat\\beta_{1}) = \\frac{1}{(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2})^2} \\times \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\textit{Var}(\\epsilon_i|X)}\\) Sample Estimatte \\(\\textit{Var}(\\hat\\beta_{1}) = \\frac{1}{(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2})^2} \\times \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 e_{i}^{2}}\\) Where \\(e_{i}^{2}\\) - Squared residual for observation i (it is basically the variance of residual given x, but we usually only have 1 observation given x) Mathematics (Matrix) \\(\\boldsymbol{\\hat\\beta_1} = (\\mathbf{X&#39;X})^{-1}(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{e_{i}^{2}x&#39;_{i}x_{i}})(\\mathbf{X&#39;X})^{-1}\\) Evaluation Simulations show that it is better than the normal estimation when sample size is large but worse when sample size is small Which version is the best? HC3 is better than HC0 and HC2 (Long &amp; Ervin, 2000) HC4 appears to be more robust than HC3 when there are influential cases and non-normal errors (See Hayes and Cai, 2007 for a review) Heteroscedastic-Autocorrelation-consistent variance estimation Description Variance estimation robust to heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation They are extensions of the HC standard error Types Newey and West (1987) Cluster Robust Standard Errors Description Standard Errors estimation that accounts for heteroscedasticity and correlated errors Based on the concept that data points can be clustered in a certain way Mathematics \\(\\textit{Var}(\\hat\\beta_{1}) = \\frac{1}{(\\sum_{i=i}^{n}{(x_{i} -

A indicator function that indicates whether 2 errors belong to the same cluster The indicator function \\(1[A]\\) equals 1 if event A happens (i and j are in the same cluster) The indicator function \\(1[A]\\) equals 0 if event A does not happen (i ad j are not in the same cluster) This results in a block matrix where the diagonal blocks are the error variance-covariance submatrices and the off-diagonal blocks are all 0s (assuming that the clusters are uncorrelated with each other) -

Transforming the plots such that the line showing the theoretical distributional values is horizontal and not diagonal The diagonal arrangement of Q-Q and P-P plots can lead to visual bias, detrending the plots can reduce visual bias Visualisation Q-Q plot for the normal distribution Concept A plot with the quantile or z-score of each of the points of a normal distribution against the quantile or z-score of each of the data points in the data (relative to the whole data) Visualisation # Q-Q plot (general) ggplot2::ggplot(data = iris, aes(sample = Sepal.Length)) + &nbsp&nbsp qqplotr::stat_qq_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.6, detrend = FALSE) + &nbsp&nbsp qqplotr::stat_qq_line(colour = \"#008898\", detrend = FALSE) + &nbsp&nbsp qqplotr::stat_qq_band(fill = \"#008898\", alpha = 0.3, detrend = FALSE) + &nbsp&nbsp labs(x = \"Theoretical Quantile\", y = \"Observed Quantile\") + &nbsp&nbsp theme_minimal() &nbsp # Q-Q plot for Model residual plot(model_object, which = 2) Statistical Tests Statistical Tests Kolmogorov-Smirnov test Shapiro-Wilk test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test Description Tests the null hypothesis that the scores are normally distributed It compares the scores to a normally distributed set of scores with the same mean and standard deviation The problem with statistical tests Statistical significance does not necessarily mean practical importance Statistical significance tells how real an effect is but does not tell the practical importance/size of the effect It doesn’t work when you need it, but works when you don’t need it (that’s what she said) The smaller the sample size, the lower the power of statistical tests, the less likely normality problems are detected by these statistical tests, however, this is when the assumption of normality is more of a concern The larger the sample size, the higher the power of statistical tests, the more likely normality problems are detected by these statistical tests, however, this is when the assumption of normality is less of a concern due to the CLT Robust methods are the way to go Violation of the normality assumption can be adjusted, hence, we don’t have to drill on statistical tests (comparing non-robust result with robust result as a sensitivity analysis may be a better option) Robust Techniques Robust Techniques Trimming Winsorizing The Bootstrap Robust Estimators Robust Estimators M-estimators L-estimators S-estimators R-estimators Extremum estimator (\\(\\hat\\theta\\)) Description Extremum Estimator - A class of estimators in which the parameters are estimated through maximisation or minimisation of a certain obective function that depends on the data The theory of extremum estimators was developed by Amemiya (1985) M-estimators Description M-estimators - Extremum estimators for which the obejct function is a sample average History These are called M-estimators because Maximum likelihood is one of the first of these estimators, hence, Huber (1981, p. 43) called these estimators as M-estimators to denote that these are “maximum likelihood-type” estimators Examples Least squares - Because the estimator is defined as a minimum of the sum of the squared errors/residuals Maximum Likelihood- Because it maximises the likelihood function over the parameter space Trimming Description Deleting scores from the extremes Robust methods tend to use trimming (e.g. trimmed mean, the median, M-estimators, etc.) Trimming can be baesd on percentage or standard deviation of the scores relative to the data Standard deviation-based trimming is a bad idea (Field, 2023) Percentage-based trimming Description Deleting certain percentage of data points from each of the extremes before any statistic is calculated 10% trimming Deleting 10% of the data points from each of the extremes If the sample size is 100, then 10 of the data points at the higher end (because 0% of 100 is 10) and 10 data points at the lower end will be deleted The median is a trimmed mean The median is the mean when all but the middle data point are trimmed A trimmed statistic A statistic that is calculated on the trimmed data (e.g. trimmed mean) Winsorizing Description Arranging the data in ascending order and replacing values outside a threshold boundary (outside of which is considered extremes of the data) woth the value at the threshold boundary Defining the threshold boundary Percentage-based threshold boundary Description The threshold boundary is determined by a percentage of the data Example The data 9, 19, 22, 4, 8, 21, 9, 10, 0, 0, 1, 17, 4, 19, 13, 11, 0, 5, 3, 4 Arrange in ascending order 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 19, 21, 22 Winsorize 5% Winsorization The bottom 5% and upper 5% of the data is replaced 5% of a data with n = 20 is 1 Hence, the bottom first data point is replaced with the value after it, and the upper first data point is replaced with the value before it 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 19, 21, 21 10% Winsorization The bottom 10% and upper 10% of the data is replaced 10% of a data with n = 20 is 2 Hence, the bottom 2 data points are replaced with the value after the second data point, the upper 2 data points are replaced with the value before the boundary 0, 0 , 0, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 19, 19, 19 20% Winsorization The data points in the bottom 20% and those in the upper 20% of the data is replaced 20% of the data of N = 20 is 4 Hence the bottom 4 data points are replace with the value at the lower boundary, the upper 4 data poitns are replaced with the value at the upper boundaryy 3, 3, 3, 3 , 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17 Standard-deviation based threshold boundary The threshold boundary is determined by the standard deviation of the data The scores at the are replaced by the unstandardised score that has a standardised score at the boundary (not repeating the actual score at the boundary as in trimming) Theil-Sen Estimator Description Robust regarding outliers among the predictor variables Mathematics \\(\\hat\\beta_{p} = \\tilde{\\beta_{p,ij}}\\) (need to double check) "],["generalised-least-squares.html", "Chapter 2 Generalised Least Squares", " Chapter 2 Generalised Least Squares Slope Estimation Description Mathematics Mathematics (Matrix) \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X&#39;V^{-1}X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X&#39;V^{-1}Y}\\) Where \\((\\mathbf{X&#39;V^{-1}X})^{-1}\\) -

such that a closed triangle is formed, any one of those vectors is the combination of the other 2 vectors - Hence, the resultant vector of 2 vectors that are joined end-to-end (or successively put

another thing (e.g. variables or vectors) It is called scalar because it is used to multiply or “scale’ other things (e.g. variables or vectors) It can also refer to any quantities that only has a magnitude or can be fully described using a magnitude (e.g. speed, mass) Unit vectors parallel to the coordinate axes Concept Unit vectors that are parallel to the coordinate axes \\(\\mathbf{i} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a unit vector that is parallel to the x-axis \\(\\mathbf{j} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a unit vector and is parallel to the y-axis \\(\\mathbf{k} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a unit vector and is parallel to the z-axis Hence, a 2-D vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\\) can be written as \\(x\\mathbf{i} + y\\mathbf{j}\\) and a 3-D vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\\) can be written as \\(x\\mathbf{i} +

are scaling that vector such that it has a length of 1 (this is done by standardising the original vector per unit) Mathematics A unit vector parallel to vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathbf{|v|}}\\) Example Consider a 2D vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) The unit vector parallel to vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathbf{|v|}} = \\frac{\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}}{5} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{4}{5} \\\\ \\frac{3}{5} \\end{pmatrix}\\) Distance between 2 points Distance between 2 3-D points Mathematics \\(d_{1,2} = \\sqrt{(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}+(z_{1}-z_{2})^{2}}\\) Explanation Imagine that we need to find the distance between the 2 black dots (or the black vector) To find the distance of the black vector, you need to first find the length of the blue and red vectors Finding the length of the blue vector Since the blue vector is parallel to the y-axis, the length of the blue vector can be found by the difference between the y-coordinates of the black dots \\(length~of~blue~vector = y_{1} - y_{2}\\) Finding the length of the red vector Since the red vector is not parallel to any of the axes, to find the length of the red vector, we need to first find the length of the yellow and green vectors so that the length of the red vector can be found by using the Pythagoras’ theorem Finding the length of the yellow vector Since the yellow vector is parallel to the x-axis, it can be found by the difference between the x-coordinates of the black dots \\(length~of~yellow~vector = x_{1} - x_{2}\\) Finding the length of the green vector Since the green vector is parallel to the z-axis, it can be found by the difference between the z-coordinates of the black dots \\(length~of~green~vector = z_{1} - z_{2}\\) Now that we know the length of the yellow and green vectors, we can apply the Pythagoras’ theorem to find the length of the red vector \\(length~of~red~vector = \\sqrt{(length~of~yellow~line)^2+(length~of~green~vector)^2}\\) \\(length~of~red~vector = \\sqrt{(x_{1} - x_{2})^2+(z_{1} - z_{2})^2}\\) Now that we know the length of the red vector and the blue vector we found earlier, we can apply the Pythagoras’ theorem to find the black vector \\(length~of~black~vector = \\sqrt{(length~of~red~line)^2+(length~of~blue~vector)^2}\\) \\(length~of~black~vector = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{(x_{1} - x_{2})^2+(z_{1} - z_{2})^2})^2+(y_{1} - y_{2})^2}\\) \\(length~of~black~vector = \\sqrt{(x_{1} - x_{2})^2+(z_{1} - z_{2})^2+(y_{1} - y_{2})^2}\\) \\(length~of~black~vector = \\sqrt{(x_{1} - x_{2})^2+(y_{1} - y_{2})^2+(z_{1} - z_{2})^2}\\) Other concepts Two vectors are equal if have the same magnitude and direction One vector is the negative of another vector if they have the same magnitude but opposite direction One vector is a scalar multiple of another vector if they have the same direction but different magnitude (they are scaled versions of each other) Collinear points are points that line on the same straight line ## Warning in is.na(x): is.na() ## applied to

basically quantifies the extent to which 2 vectors interact with each other (or how much each of the two vectors reinforce each other in their magnitude) When the vectors are orthogonal to each other, in other words, they don’t interact with each other, then they have a dot product of \\(0\\) (because when 2 vectors are orthogonal, \\(\\theta = 90\\), and \\(\\cos{90} = 0\\), therefore, the dot product is \\(0\\) ) When 2 vectors are parallel to each other, in other words, they full interact with each other, then they have a dot product of \\(|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|\\) Mathematics The usual form \\(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = |\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|\\cos{\\theta}\\) The component form \\(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\sum_{i=1}^{d}{a_{d}b_{d}}\\) \\(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = a_{1}b_{1} + a_{2}b_{2} + a_{3}b_{3} + \\cdots + a_{d}b_{d}\\) Where \\(a_{d}\\) - The magnitude of vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) in the direction of the d axis \\(b_{d}\\) - The magnitude of vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in the direction of the d axis \\(a_{d}b_{d}\\) - The combined magnitude of vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in the direction of the d-axis \\(d\\) - The total number of dimensions Explanation Given 2 2-D vectors, vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) The combined magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) The magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) (\\(\\mathbf{a}_{\\mathbf{b}}\\)) can be found using the ratio of \\(\\cos{}\\) \\(\\mathbf{a}_{\\mathbf{b}} = |\\mathbf{a}|\\cos{\\theta}\\) The combined magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is the multiplicative effect between the magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{a}_{\\mathbf{b}}\\)) and the magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) \\(\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = |\\mathbf{a}|\\cos{\\theta} |\\mathbf{b}|\\) The combined magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) The magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) (\\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{a}}\\)) can be found using the ratio of \\(\\cos{}\\) \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{a}} = |\\mathbf{b}|\\cos{\\theta}\\) The combined magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is multiplicative effect between the magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathbf{a}}\\)) and the magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) \\(\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = |\\mathbf{b}|\\cos{\\theta}|\\mathbf{a}|\\) Duality We can see that the combined magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is exactly the same as the combined magnitude of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in the direction of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\). Hence, the order does not matter (\\(\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}\\)) Alternative thinking \\(|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|\\) is the maximum possible amount of interaction between the 2 vectors \\(\\cos{\\theta}\\) is like a quantity that quantifies how much the 2 vectors project to the same direction as each other. This quantity ranges from -1 to +1. +1 means that the 2 vectors are fully in the same direction. When the 2 vectors are entirely in the same direction, then \\(\\theta = 0\\) and \\(\\cos{90} = 1\\) When the 2 vectors are entirely in the opposite direction, then \\(\\theta = 180\\) and \\(\\cos{180} = -1\\) When the 2 vectors are orthogonal to each other, then \\(\\theta = 90\\) and \\(\\cos{90} = 0\\) \\(|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}| \\cos{\\theta}\\) is like scaling \\(|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|\\) by the factor \\(\\cos{\\theta}\\) such that the result reflects the amount of interaction between the 2 vectors When \\(\\cos{90} = 1\\), then you get the maximum possible amount of interaction When \\(\\cos{180} = -1\\), then you get maximum possible amount of interaction When \\(\\cos{0} = 0\\), then you 0 percent of that interaction Other tips \\(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c}) = \\mathbf{a} \\cdot\\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{a} \\cdot\\mathbf{c}\\) "],["anova.html", "Chapter 4 ANOVA", " Chapter 4 ANOVA ANOVA Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Concept Under the null hypothesis, it assumes that each of the groups is an independent random sample from the population ANOVA involves assessing the agreement between two estimators of the population variance The Statistical Model of ANOVA Concept The value of observation \\(i\\) on outcome variable \\(y\\) is the grand mean plus the effect of the grouping variable it is in plus random error Mathematics \\(y_{i,k} = \\mu + \\tau_{k} + \\epsilon_{i, k}\\) Where \\(y_{i,k}\\) -

Using the sample \\(MS_B\\) and \\(MS_W\\) as estimators of \\(E(MS_B)\\) and \\(E(MS_B)\\) respectively would yield an \\(F\\) statistic that is close to 1 If the null hypothesis is false, that is when at least one of the \\(\\tau_ks &gt; 0\\) (\\(\\sum_{k=1}^{k}{\\tau_k^2} &gt; 0\\)), in other words, when at least one of the populations is different, the expected value \\(E(MS_B)\\) consists of both the random variation in the superpopulation and the overall variation induced by the groups (\\(E(MS_B) = \\sigma^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{k-1} \\right)\\sum_{k=1}^{k}{n_k\\tau_k^2}\\)), then \\(F = \\frac{E(MS_B)}{E(MS_W)} = \\frac{\\sigma^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{k-1} \\right)\\sum_{k=1}^{k}{n_k\\tau_k^2}}{\\sigma^2}\\), where \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{k-1} \\right)\\sum_{k=1}^{k}{n_k\\tau_k^2} &gt; 0\\), the \\(F\\) statistic will be larger than 1 NHST The null hypothesis of ANOVA is thus tested by an Upper-Tail \\(F\\) test The distribution of the F-statistic Concept Since \\(MS_B\\) is \\(SS_B\\) (a chi-squared-distributed independent random variable) divided by its degrees of freedom, and \\(MS_W\\) is \\(SS_W\\) (another chi-squared-distributed random variable) divided by its degrees of freedom, the ratio of \\(MS_B\\) to \\(MS_W\\) has a Central \\(F\\) distribution, that is an \\(F\\) distribution with a degrees of freedom for the numerator of \\(v_1 = k-1\\) and a degrees of freedom for the denominator of \\(v_2 = N - k\\) for the denominator Mathematics \\(F_{central} \\sim F\\left(k - 1, N - k \\right)\\) The F test Concept The process of assessing the probability of an F statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the observed F statistic in the Central F distribution NHST for ANOVA Hypotheses Null hypothesis Concept There are no difference between the means The samples are from the same population Mathematics \\(H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 = \\cdots = \\mu_k\\) or \\((\\tau_k - \\bar{\\tau})^2 = 0\\) Alternative hypothesis Concept At least one of the samples is likely from another population Mathematics \\(H_1: \\mu_1 ≠ \\mu_2 ≠ \\mu_3 ≠ \\cdots ≠ \\mu_k\\) or \\((\\tau_k - \\bar{\\tau})^2 &gt; 0\\) NHST The null hypothesis is tested by an upper-tailed \\(F\\) test The null hypothesis is tested by assessing the probability of getting an F-statistic equal to or larger than the observed \\(F\\) statistic in the Central \\(F\\) distribution The F test for 2 samples is equivalent to the t test \\(H_0: \\sum_{k=1}^{k}{\\tau_k^2} = 0\\) (operationally) - Hypothesis Testing for ANOVA Total Sum of Squares Concept The Sum of Squares that represents the total amount of variation in the outcome variable It is the sum of all the squared deviations between each observed value and the grand mean Visualisation Mathematics \\(\\displaystyle \\begin{alignat*}{10} {SS_{T}} = {\\sum_{k=1}^{k}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}{(y_{i,k} - \\bar{y})^2}}} \\end{alignat*}\\) Where \\(k\\) represents group \\(k\\) \\(i\\) represents observation \\(i\\) \\(y_{i,k}\\) - Observation \\(i\\) in group \\(k\\) \\(\\bar{y}\\) - The grand mean Notes Alternatively, it can be expressed simply as: \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^{n}{(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\\) Total degrees of freedom \\(\\begin{aligned}df_T &amp;= df_M + df_E \\\\ df_T &amp;= N-1 \\end{aligned}\\) Mean Total Sum of Squares (Total Variance) Concept Total Variance in the outcome variable The mean amount of variation in the outcome variable The average amount by squared deviation between each observation and the grand mean It is the standardised version of the Total Sum of Squares Because the Total Sum of Squares is the sum of all the squared deviations, it depends on the degrees of freedom.

test Based on ranked scores Scores are grouped together and then transformed into ranked scores, the ranked scores are analysed The null hypothesis is tested by the \\(K\\) statistic (a chi-squared transformed ranked version of the \\(SS_B\\); see below) It involves assessing the probability of having a \\(K\\) statistic equal to or more extreme than the observed \\(K\\) statistic in the distribution of \\(K\\) under the null hypothesis (that the samples are from the same population - That there are no differences between samples) (because the statistic is standardised, the K statistic basically assess how much bigger the observed SSB is compared to the SSB in under the null, because the SSB statistic is converted to a standardised Chi-squared statistic, it compares how much bigger the standardised version of the SSB is compare to 1, because the sd (or se) of the chi-squared distribution is 1, this is the natural variation measured as sd in the null chi-squared distribution, the K statistic tells you how many times the observed SSB (or estimate of the variance of the population) is larger than the variance of the null distribution, again the variance is measured as sd) It involves enumerating the null distribution of \\(SS_B\\) for all possible combinations of \\(k\\) and \\(n_k\\) The Kruskal Wallis \\(SS_B\\) Let \\(R_{ik}\\) be the rank of

This means that the variates are orthogonal to each other Variate Concept A linear combination of outcome variables A variate is also called a linear discriminant function to reflect its goal of discriminating groups In a discriminant function analysis, different variates are identified and they are defined by the specific set of weights for the outcome variables (outcome variables are combined differently) Variates are latent variables (aka underlying dimensions/constructs of the outcome variables) Mathematics \\(\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned} V &amp;= \\sum_{p=1}^{p}{\\beta_{p}y_{p}} \\\\ &amp;= \\beta_{1}y_{1} + \\beta_{2}y_{2} + \\beta_{3}y_{3} + \\cdots + \\beta_{p}y_{p}\\end{aligned}\\) Where The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the \\(\\mathbf{HE}^{-1}\\) matrix Concept Each of the eigenvectors of the \\(\\mathbf{HE}^{-1}\\) matrix represents a variate and the components in an eigenvector are the set of weights for the outcome variables in the variate and the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector represents the ratio of variance in the variate explained by the predictor variable(s) to the variance in that variate unexplained by the predictor variable(s) Mathematics \\(\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned}\\lambda_v &amp;= \\frac{SS_{M_{v}}}{SS_{R_{v}}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_{k = 1}^{k}{n_k (\\bar{x}_{k} - \\bar{x}_{grand})}}{\\sum_{n=1, k = 1}^{n, k}{(x_{i, k} - \\bar{x}_{k})}} \\end{aligned}\\) Example \\(\\lambda_1\\) is the ratio of the variance on LDF 1 explained by the predictor variable(s) to the variance on LDF 1 not explained by the predictor variable(s) Factor loading Concept Aka structure r’s The relationship between each component of a dimension/construct and the dimension/construct itself Factor loading in discriminant analysis Concept The relationship between each outcome variable in the variate and the variate itself (sometimes called the LDF-Variable correlations) That is how much each outcome variable in the variate contribute to the variate Assessing factor loading Methods Total group structure correlations Between-group structure correlation Within-group structure correlation Which is the best one?? Huberty and Olejnik (2006) advocates within-group structure correlation as it takes into account the group differences of mean vectors (which is meaningful) Interpreting variates Label of a variate The label of a variate should be based on the outcome variables with higher factor loading because these outcome variables are strongly contributing to the variate Dropping variates You may choose to drop the variates that are less meaningful (e.g. those with low eigenvalues) The LDF plot Concept A plot in which each of the axes represents each of the LDFs/variates and the scores represent scores of the original data that are transformed into variate scores (by putting the original scores into the LDFs) Types of LDF plot The mean LDF plot The mean LDF plot Description An LDF plot which plots the group LDF mean centroids (the group mean centroid but transformed into variate score) It can be used to determine the number of LDFs to retain for interpretation Constructing the mean LDF plot For group g on variate v, put the original group means on the discriminant variables into the corresponding places in the vth linear discriminant function, the result of that is the mean for group g on variate v Dropping/retaining variates Methods for dropping/retaining variates Proportion of variance based "],["catgorical-outcomes.html", "Chapter 7 Catgorical outcomes", " Chapter 7 Catgorical outcomes Analysing Categorical Outcomes Concept The process of analysing categorical outcomes Statistics Binomial test Pearson’s Chi-squared Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Chi-squared test McNemar’s test Fisher’s Exact Test Barnard’s exact test Boschloo’s test G-test Cramér’s V Pearson’s Chi-squared test (Pearson, 1900) Concept A statistical test that tests the null hypothesis that 2 categorical variables are independent Test of independence between 2 categorical variable is like a test of homogeneity of conditional distributions For example, if factor A and factor B are independent, then the conditional probabilities are homogeneous (\\(P(\\text{Married once} | \\text{College}) = P( \\text{Married once}| \\text{No College})\\)) Conceptual Hypotheses Null Hypothesis The two categorical variables are independent Alternative Hypothesis The two categorical variables are not independent (they are associated) The probability of each cell under the null hypothesis Concept The probability of each joint-category under the null hypothesis Mathematics \\(\\pi_{ij} = \\pi_{i\\cdot} \\pi_{\\cdot j}\\) Estimation Concept The maximum likelihood estimation of the population probability of each of the joint-categories Mathematics \\(\\displaystyle \\hat{\\pi}_{ij} = \\hat\\pi_{i\\cdot} \\hat\\pi_{\\cdot j} = \\frac{n_{i \\cdot}}{n} \\times \\frac{n_{\\cdot j}}{n} = \\frac{n_{i \\cdot} n_{\\cdot j}}{n^2}\\) Where \\(n_{i\\cdot}\\) - The number of observations in the \\(i\\)th row \\(n_{\\cdot j}\\) - The number of observations in the \\(j\\)th column \\(n\\) - The total sample size The expected number of observations Concept The number of observations in each of the K joint-categories under the null hypothesis that the 2 categorical variables are independent Mathematics \\(\\displaystyle E(n_{ij}) = n\\hat{\\pi}_{ij} = n\\frac{n_{i \\cdot} n_{\\cdot j}}{n^2} = \\frac{n_{i \\cdot} n_{\\cdot j}}{n}\\) Pearson’s Chi-squared statistic Concept The sum of the standardised squared deviations of the observed number of observations and the expected number of observations under the null hypothesis of each of the K joint-categories Mathematics \\(\\begin{aligned} \\displaystyle \\chi^2 &amp;= \\sum_{i = 1}^{I}{\\sum_{j = 1}^{J}{\\frac{\\left[ n_{ij} - E(n_{ij})\\right]^2}{E(n_{ij})}}} \\\\ \\displaystyle &amp;= \\sum_{i = 1}^{I}{\\sum_{j = 1}^{J}{\\frac{\\left( n_{ij} - \\frac{n_{i\\cdot} n_{\\cdot j}}{n}\\right)^2}{\\frac{n_{i\\cdot} n_{\\cdot j}}{n}}}} \\end{aligned}\\) Where \\(n_{ij}\\) - The observed number of observations in joint-category \\(ij\\) \\(E(n_{jk}\\) - The expected number of observations in joint-category \\(ij\\) under the null hypothesis \\(\\left( n_{ij} - \\frac{n_{i\\cdot} n_{\\cdot j}}{n}\\right)^2\\) - The squared deviation for for joint-category \\(ij\\) Degrees of freedom (NOT ENTIRELY SURE) Concept The degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis is the number of joint-categories minus the number of independent linear restrictions placed on the cell probabilities Although the calculation of the number of degrees of freedom depends on the application of the Chi-squared test, the general principle is that the appropriate number of degrees of freedom will equal the number of joint-categories minus 1 df for each independent linear restriction placed on the cell probabilities.

the y-axis represents the probability) (if trials are not independent or identical, \\(y\\) will not follow a binomial distribution, they will follow other distributions; e.g. hypergeometric distribution is for the case when trials are not independent;

Now imagine we have \\(16\\) of this trial, the combination could be something like 4, 4, 4, 4. The multinomial distribution models the probability of getting different combinations. In the case of 4, 4, 4, 4, this is a fair trial (the null hypothesis), where each of the categories have equal chance of occurrence, so this combination after \\(16\\) trials would be the most probable (it has a probability of 0.50), whereas a combination of something like 6, 5, 3, 2 would be less probable in the null multinomial distribution The outcome of a single trial (\\(y_i\\)) Concept There are multiple but fixed number of possible outcomes in a single random, independent, and identical trial Mathematics \\(y_i = (y_{i,1}, y_{i,2}, \\cdots , y_{i,k})\\) Where \\(k\\) -

The estimate with the highest likelihood is the MLE - This estimate has the highest probability of being obtained given the true population parameter value Usually, the likelihood function is logged for further purposes, logging the likelihood function will result in a concave graph Likelihood ratio Concept The ratio of one likelihood and another likelihood Maximum Likelihood Estimation Maximum Likelihood Estimation Concept An estimation method in which the model parameters are estimated by finding the parameters of the statistical model that maximizes the likelihood of obtaining the data through setting the partial derivative of the particular likelihood function to 0 Because the likelihood curve is concave, setting this to 0 will get the maxima of the curve; the point that represents the highest possible likelihood of obtaining the sample data) Sometimes it is called Maximum Log Likelihood because the function is logged for simplifying the calculation during the maximisation problem Maximum Likelihood Estimation for binomial Parameter MLE for the population parameter Concept The log likelihood of the kernal Mathematics The log likelihood function: \\(\\begin{aligned} \\displaystyle \\mathcal{L}(\\pi)&amp;=\\log{\\left[\\pi^{y}(1-\\pi)^{n-y}\\right]} \\\\ \\displaystyle &amp;= y\\log(\\pi)+(n-y)\\log(1-\\pi) \\end{aligned}\\) The derivative of the likelihood function: \\(\\begin{aligned} \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial{\\mathcal{L}(\\pi)}}{\\partial{\\pi}} &amp;= \\frac{y}{\\pi} -
