\\bar{x})^2}}\\)) is a biased estimate of the true variance of the sampling distribution If errors are positively correlated, the standard mathematical expression of the estimate of the variance of the sampling distribution (\\(\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_{i,1} - \\bar{x})^2}}\\)) will underestimate the true value (a negative bias), this means that the true sampling variance and SE are larger than estimated, this means that OLS is less efficient/optimal than other estimators, this follows that all statisticl inferences involving the SE will be biased (e.g. underestimating the confidence intervals, overestimating the p-value in significance tests, higher Type I error etc.) Assessing Autocorrelation See the autcorrelation section Treatment Autocorrelation consistent standard errors Cluster robust standard errors Use other estimators Normality of the Sampling Distribution Concept The sampling distribution of the sample estimates is normally distributed A normally distributed sampling distribution is desirable because it can be modelled easily with the normal distribution curve and inferential statistics can be easily derived (which may be easier than if it has a non-normal distribution, e.g. Pearson’s r) Effects of violation of the assumption All the standard mathematical expressions and procedures for estimating the inferential statistics and uncertainty of the sample estimate are based on the assumption that the sampling distribution is normal or at least approximately normal. If the true sampling distribution is not normal, then all the inferential statistics and estimates of uncertainty of the sample estimate are incorrect Assessing Normality of the sampling distribution Distribution of model residuals Description Assess whether the model residuals are normally distributed Explanation In general, in a linear combination of variables, if the variables in the linear combination are random, independent, and normally distributed (their sampling distribution), then the linear combination itself is also normally distributed (the sampling distribution of the linear combination is normal) Each of the regression parameters can be expressed as a linear combination \\(\\hat\\beta_{1} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x} )y_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}y_i}\\) Where \\(\\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}\\) is treated as a constant and \\(y_i\\) is treated a variable Hence, for the linear combination (\\(\\hat\\beta_1\\)) to be normally distributed, the random variable \\(y_i\\) has to be independent and normally distributed Since independence and normality of the errors imply independence and normality of the random variable \\(y_i\\), normality of errors can be used to indicate that the linear combination (\\(\\hat\\beta_1\\)) is normally distributed And since we don’t have the errors in hand, we use the model residuals Assessing normality See the ‘Assessing Normality’ section The Central Limit Theorem and the assumption of normality The distribution of the residuals is not important if sample size is “sufficiently” large according to the Central Limit Theorem. (The CLT states that the sampling distribution is approximately normal if sample size is large and can be assumed to be normal if sample size is sufficiently large (n &gt; 30) regardless of the shape of the population distribution) Hence, there is much less to worry about the non-normality of the sampling distribution if the sample size is “sufficiently” large Just some side notes \\(y_i\\) also needs to be normally distributed, if y is not normally distributed, then the scores of y need to be transformed such that it’s sampling distribution is normal or approximately normal (I am still not sure about this part) Treatment Use robust/non-parametric methods Transformation Heteroscedasticity Description Aka - Homogeneity of variance or constant variance The variance of the distribution of errors given x is the identical between values of x in the population model The variance of the distribution of errors given x is a constant - It is a fixed value and does not vary across values of x in the population model Some sources say that the variance of errors given x does not depend on x (e.g. Rice, 2006; Field, 2023) Visualisation Mathematics \\(\\text{Var}(\\epsilon_{i}) = \\sigma^2\\) Mathematics (Matrix) \\(\\boldsymbol\\Phi = E(\\epsilon\\epsilon&#39;|X) = \\Sigma_{\\epsilon\\epsilon} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma^{2} &amp; \\phi_{1,2} &amp; \\phi_{1,3} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi_{1,j} \\\\ \\phi_{2,1} &amp; \\sigma^{2} &amp; \\phi_{2,3} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi_{2,j} \\\\ \\phi_{3,1} &amp; \\phi_{3,2} &amp; \\sigma^{2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\phi_{3,j} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\phi_{i,1} &amp; \\phi_{i,2} &amp; \\phi_{i,3} &amp;\\cdots &amp; \\sigma^{2} \\end{bmatrix}\\) Notes The variances in the diagonals are all \\(\\sigma^2\\) The covariances in the off-diagonals can vary (the covariances are not the condition here) Effects of Homoscedasticity Biased estimation of sampling variance The mathematical expression for the estimate of the sampling variance assumes homoscedasticity (see derivation) (or rather, requires homoscedasticity to be unbiased). If there is heteroscedasticity, then the sampling variance estimated using the same standard mathematical expression will be biased, in that the estimated value is not the same as the true value, this in turn means that the parameter estimates are not optimal due to increased sampling variation and there are other estimators that will be mor efficient than OLS, the biased sampling variance estimate will affect the SE estimate, and will affect all statistical inferences using the sampling variance (e.g. confidence intervals, test statistic, p-values etc.) Confidence intervals can be “extremely inaccurate” when ignoring heteroscedasticity (Wilcox, 2010) But this assumption matters only if group sizes are unequal Assessing Homo/Heteroscedasticity Description The assumption applies to the population model, it is best to assess heteroscedasticity in the population through heteroscedasticity in the sample model Ways to assess heteroscedasticity Plots Statistical tests Plots Residual Plots Residuals vs fitted plot Residuals vs fitted plot Description The residuals are plotted against the fitted values A plot that shows the vertical distribution of residuals in the y-axis for each of the fitted values in the x-axis Basically it is the scatter plot but detrended It can be based on raw or standardised scores Visualisation ## Base R model &nbsp plot(model, which = 1) Statistical Tests Statistical Tests Levene’s test Brown-Forsythe test Hartley’s Fmax Levene’s tests Description Tests the null hypothesis that the variances in different groups are equal It is a one-way ANOVA with absolute deviation as the outcome variable and the groups/values of x as the predictor variable It tests whether the absolute deviation varies between groups/values of x Original Levene’s test Mathematics \\(\\textit{W} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{n_{g}(|\\bar{d}|_{g} - |\\bar{d}|_{G})^2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{n_{g}(|{d}|_{i} - |\\bar{d}|_{g})^2}} \\times \\frac{n-k}{k-1}\\) Where \\(g\\) - Denotes group \\(G\\) - Denotes grand \\(d_i = y_i - \\bar{y}_{g}\\) - A deviation means the difference between a score and mean of the group in which it belongs Note Levene’s test statistic is expressed as such but it can be interpreted as the F-statistic Brown-Forsythe test Description Similar to Levene’s test but uses the median in the absolute deviation instead (\\(d_i = y_i - \\tilde{y}_{g}\\)) Levene’s test using trimmed mean Description Similar to Levene’s test but uses the trimmed mean instead of the mean Comparing the tests Trimmed mean performed best when the underlying data followed a Cauchy distribution and the median performed best when the data followed a chi-squared distribution with 4 degrees of freedom (sharply skewed distribution) (Brown &amp; Forsythe, 1974; extracted from Wiki) Hartley’s Fmax (Pearson &amp; Harley, 1954) Description It is the ratio of the variances between the group with the biggest variance and the group with the smallest variance It then conducts a null hypothesis significance test for the ratio The Fmax isn’t used very often, so it is harder to find a critical value table Mathematics \\(\\textit{F}_{max} = \\frac{\\max{s_{g}^{2}}}{\\min{s_{g}^{2}}}\\) Where \\(\\max{s_{g}^{2}}\\) - The largest group variance among all the groups \\(\\min{s_{g}^{2}}\\) - The smallest group variance among all the groups Cochrane’s C test Description It tests whether the variance of a particular group is exceptionally larger than the rest of the group (it is an upper tail test) The test statistic is the ratio of the variane of a group of interest and the overall variance (of all of the groups) It then conducts a null hypothesis significance test on the ratio It is used to test for variance outlier Mathematics \\(\\textit{C}_{g} = \\frac{s_{g}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{s_{g}^{2}}}\\) Where \\(s_{g}^{2}\\) - The variance of a particular group \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{s_{g}^{2}}\\) - The sum of all the variances (the total variance) Null Hypothesis Significance Test Hypothesis \\(\\textit{H}_{0}:\\) All variances are equal \\(\\textit{H}_{1}:\\) At least one group variance is significantly larger than the other variances Don’t use these tests Sample size In large samples, even trivial heteroscedasticity can produce significant Levene’s result In small samples, Levene’s test has inadequate power to detect heteroscedasticity Group size equality Homoscedasticity tests work best when group sample sizes are equal (when heteroscedasticity does not matter as mentioned before) and does not work well when sample sizes are unequal (when heteroscedasticity matters) Adjust for it instead… There are robust methods for heteroscedasticity, hence, no need to drill on testing heteroscedasticity Read Zimmerman (2004) about the problems with heteroscedasticity tests… Remedies Heteroscedasticity-Consistent Standard Errors Weighted Least Squares Heteroscedasticity-Consistent Standard Error Description Aka Heteroscedasticity-Robust Standard Errors Robust Standard Errors Eicker-Huber-White standard errors Huber-White Standard Errors White Standard Errors Sandwich Estimator (because the matrix expression looks like a sandwich) Versions HC1 HC2 HC3 HC4 HC0 Description The first version of the HC standard error Mathematical desciption In the mathematical expression of the estimate of the sampling variance of the beta parameters, the variance of errors given x is not treated as fixed/a constant, rather, it relaxes the assumption of homoscedasticity and treat the variance of errors given x are different at different values of x Mathematics Population Model \\(\\textit{Var}(\\hat\\beta_{1}) = \\frac{1}{(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2})^2} \\times \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\textit{Var}(\\epsilon_i|X)}\\) Sample Estimatte \\(\\textit{Var}(\\hat\\beta_{1}) = \\frac{1}{(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2})^2} \\times \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 e_{i}^{2}}\\) Where \\(e_{i}^{2}\\) - Squared residual for observation i (it is basically the variance of residual given x, but we usually only have 1 observation given x) Mathematics (Matrix) \\(\\boldsymbol{\\hat\\beta_1} = (\\mathbf{X&#39;X})^{-1}(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{e_{i}^{2}x&#39;_{i}x_{i}})(\\mathbf{X&#39;X})^{-1}\\) Evaluation Simulations show that it is better than the normal estimation when sample size is large but worse when sample size is small Which version is the best? HC3 is better than HC0 and HC2 (Long &amp; Ervin, 2000) HC4 appears to be more robust than HC3 when there are influential cases and non-normal errors (See Hayes and Cai, 2007 for a review) Heteroscedastic-Autocorrelation-consistent variance estimation Description Variance estimation robust to heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation They are extensions of the HC standard error Types Newey and West (1987) Cluster Robust Standard Errors Description Standard Errors estimation that accounts for heteroscedasticity and correlated errors Based on the concept that data points can be clustered in a certain way Mathematics Autocorrelation Description Aka serial correlation Errors given x are correlated with errors in other values of x Autocorrelation is often described with respect to time because autocorrelation usually occurs in time series data (correlated across time) Reasons for autocorrelation Temporal autocorrelation Description Autocorrelation across time time Examples Repeated measures designs Time series Longitudinal designs Growth models Spatial autocorrelation Description Autocorrelation due to space Examples Clustered data Ignoring covariates If a covariate is not included in the model, the errors will capture the effect of that covariate The error is not random - There are systematic process in the errors that are mistreated as random or ignored Model misspecification E.g. ignoring linearity Measurement error in the independent variable Types of serial correlation First-order serial correlation First-order serial correlation Description The correlation between errors at any one point of x (\\(e_{x}\\)) and errors at the point of x that is 1 unit less (\\(e_{x-1}\\)) Note that t is often used instead of x, but I am keeping things general here Visualisation Positive first-order serial correlation Negative first-order serial correlation Mathematical concept Tests testing for first-order serial correlation usually assess whether errors given \\(x\\) can be predicted by errors a unit of x that is 1 unit smaller (\\(x -

Negative serial correlation Significance testing Statistical significance of the Durbin-Watson statistic us often sort through assessing whether the observed Durbin-Watson statistic is inside or outside the critical boundary in the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis The critical boundary is a function of sample size and the number of variables Breusch-Godfrey test (Breusch &amp; Godfrey, 1978) Concept Aka auxiliary regression (A regression for supplementary purposes) Tests the extent to which the errors given x can be predicted by the predictor in the model and the model error at a value of x that is 1 less, model error at a value of x that is 2 less, model error at a value of x that is 3 less, and so on (these are the lagged variables, and the number of lagged variables is defined by the researcher, but some people may include lagged variables until the errors in that auxiliary regression is no longer autocorrelated) Mathematics \\(e_{t} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_i + \\beta_{2}e_{t-1} + \\beta_{3}e_{t-2} + \\beta_{4}e_{t-3} + \\cdots + \\beta_{p+1}e_{t-p} + u_i\\) Null Hypothesis Significance Test The Breusch-Godfrey test statistic Mathematics (wiki) \\(nR^2\\) Distribution of the Breusch-Godfrey test statistic \\(nR^2 \\sim{} \\chi_{p}^{2}\\) Warning A source (zed statistics) said it is \\((n-p)R^2 \\sim{} \\chi_{p}^{2}\\) But they are very similar, so I think it’s fine Hypotheses \\(H_0:\\) There is no autocorrelation \\(H_1:\\) There is autocorrelation in the lagged variables in the model Assessing Normality Ways to assess normality Plots Statistical Tests Plots Types of plots Frequency Distribution plot (e.g. histogram) Theoretical vs Observed distribution plots Theoretical vs Observed Distribution plots Description A plot with the distributional points of a particular distribution of interest and the distributional points of the data It visualises how well the distributional point of each of the data points fit their corresponding distributional point a particular distribution of interest (e.g. a normal distribution) The corresponding distributional point is the expected value that the observed score should have in a particular distribution of interest Types P-P plot Q-Q plot P-P plot Description A plot with the probability of each of the points of a particular distribution of interest against the probability of each of the data points in the data (relative to the whole data) P-P plot for the normal distribution Concept A plot with the probability of each of the points of a normal distribution against the probability of each of the data points in the data (relative to the whole data) Q-Q plot Description A plot with the quantile or z-score of each of the points of a particular distribution of interest against the quantile or z-score of each of the data points in the data (relative to the whole data) Detrending (Thode, 2002) Concept Detrending - Transforming the plots such that the line showing the theoretical distributional values is horizontal and not diagonal The diagonal arrangement of Q-Q and P-P plots can lead to visual bias, detrending the plots can reduce visual bias Visualisation Q-Q plot for the normal distribution Concept A plot with the quantile or z-score of each of the points of a normal distribution against the quantile or z-score of each of the data points in the data (relative to the whole data) Visualisation # Q-Q plot (general) ggplot2::ggplot(data = iris, aes(sample = Sepal.Length)) + &nbsp&nbsp qqplotr::stat_qq_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.6, detrend = FALSE) + &nbsp&nbsp qqplotr::stat_qq_line(colour = \"#008898\", detrend = FALSE) + &nbsp&nbsp qqplotr::stat_qq_band(fill = \"#008898\", alpha = 0.3, detrend = FALSE) + &nbsp&nbsp labs(x = \"Theoretical Quantile\", y = \"Observed Quantile\") + &nbsp&nbsp theme_minimal() &nbsp # Q-Q plot for Model residual plot(model_object, which = 2) Statistical Tests Statistical Tests Kolmogorov-Smirnov test Shapiro-Wilk test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test Description Tests the null hypothesis that the scores are normally distributed It compares the scores to a normally distributed set of scores with the same mean and standard deviation The problem with statistical tests Statistical significance does not necessarily mean practical importance Statistical significance tells how real an effect is but does not tell the practical importance/size of the effect It doesn’t work when you need it, but works when you don’t need it (that’s what she said) The smaller the sample size, the lower the power of statistical tests, the less likely normality problems are detected by these statistical tests, however, this is when the assumption of normality is more of a concern The larger the sample size, the higher the power of statistical tests, the more likely normality problems are detected by these statistical tests, however, this is when the assumption of normality is less of a concern due to the CLT Robust methods are the way to go Violation of the normality assumption can be adjusted, hence, we don’t have to drill on statistical tests (comparing non-robust result with robust result as a sensitivity analysis may be a better option) "],["the-pool-of-tears.html", "Chapter 2 The pool of tears", " Chapter 2 The pool of tears "],["a-caucus-race-and-a-long-tale.html", "Chapter 3 A caucus-race and a long tale", " Chapter 3 A caucus-race and a long tale This is chapter 3, and I will talk about robust methods in this chapter.
