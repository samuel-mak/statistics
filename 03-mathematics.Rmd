## Functions 

<p style = "margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 20px; ">**Functions**</p>

- **Concept**
  - **Function** - A mathematical relational expression that maps each value of a set of inputs to a single output 
- **Related concepts**
  - **Domain of a function** - The set of possible inputs for a function 
  - **Range of a function** - The set of possible outputs of a function 
  - **Root of a function** - The values of x for which the output is 0 ($f(x) = 0$)
  - **Inverse of a function** - A function that is a reversal of another function (it reverses the subject)
- **The components of a function**
  - **Variables**
    - **Concept**
      - Aka indeterminates
      - **Variable** - Anything that can vary in quantity 
      - A function consists of variables of which the output is a function (in other words, a function consists of variables that varies with the outcome variable)
  - **Coefficient**
    - **Concept**
      - **Coefficients** - Constants that act as multipliers for the variables
    - **The intercept**
      - **Concept**
        - The intercept is the coefficient for the variable with an exponent of 0
      - **What the intercept tells us??**
        - **In general sense**
          - The intercept defines the change on the y-axis from the x-axis in addition to the terms with variables in the function. In terms of graphical transformation, the intercept defines how the graph of the function is shifted on the y-axis from the x-axis 
        - **In terms of the intercept**
          - The intercept defines the y value when x = 0 (or the value of $f(0)$). In terms of graphical transformation, the intercept defines the value of y in the coordinate of the graph that touches the y-axis

<p style = "margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 20px; ">**Polynomial Functions**</p>

- **Concept**
  - **Polynomial functions** - Functions that are made up of the sum of one or more algebraic terms each of which is the product of a coefficient and one or more variables each of which has a non-negative integer exponent 
  - **The Leading Coefficient** - The coefficient of the variable term with the highest degree or the largest exponent in a polynomial function - The leading coefficient in a polynomial function must not be 0
  - **Degree of a polynomial**
    - The highest possible degree of the polynomial's monomial (individual terms) with non-zero coefficients (the degree of a term is the exponent of the variable)
- **Types of Polynomial Function**
  - **Polynomials by degree**
    - A constant (degree of 0)
    - Linear (degree of 1)
    - Quadratic (degree of 2)
    - Cubic (degree of 3)
    - Quartic (degree of 4)
